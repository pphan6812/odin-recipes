        <h2>What is Ramen?</h2>
        <p>Ramen is a Japanese dish that consists of Chinese-style noodles served in either meat or fish-based broth. It is often flavored with soy sauce or miso. The dish is finished with toppings such as sliced pork, dried seaweed, and green onions. Ramen became extremely popular after WW II due to its convenience in a different style of ramen known as instant ramen noodles. In today's time, ramen is enjoyed all around the globe, with many international variations spin on the iconic dish happening throughout the world. </p>
